            "title": "RAVEN: Erasing Invisible Watermarks via Novel View Synthesis",
            "summary": "Invisible watermarking has become a critical mechanism for authenticating AI-generated image content, with major platforms deploying watermarking schemes at scale. However, evaluating the vulnerability of these schemes against sophisticated removal attacks remains essential to assess their reliability and guide robust design. In this work, we expose a fundamental vulnerability in invisible watermarks by reformulating watermark removal as a view synthesis problem. Our key insight is that generating a perceptually consistent alternative view of the same semantic content, akin to re-observing a scene from a shifted perspective, naturally removes the embedded watermark while preserving visual fidelity. This reveals a critical gap: watermarks robust to pixel-space and frequency-domain attacks remain vulnerable to semantic-preserving viewpoint transformations. We introduce a zero-shot diffusion-based framework that applies controlled geometric transformations in latent space, augmented with view-guided correspondence attention to maintain structural consistency during reconstruction. Operating on frozen pre-trained models without detector access or watermark knowledge, our method achieves state-of-the-art watermark suppression across 15 watermarking methods--outperforming 14 baseline attacks while maintaining superior perceptual quality across multiple datasets.",

            "title": "Older Adults' Preferences for Feedback Cadence from an Exercise Coach Robot",
            "summary": "People can respond to feedback and guidance in different ways, and it is important for robots to personalize their interactions and utilize verbal and nonverbal communication cues. We aim to understand how older adults respond to different cadences of verbal and nonverbal feedback of a robot exercise coach. We conducted an online study of older adults, where participants evaluated videos of the robot giving feedback at different cadences for each modality. The results indicate that changing the cadence of one modality affects the perception of both it and the other modality. We can use the results from this study to better design the frequency of the robot coach's feedback during an exercise session with this population.",
